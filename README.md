## Project Overview

SyriaTel, a telecommunications company faces major issues in retaining its customers.SyriaTel Company has a high churn rate of 14.49% .This churn rate has reduced its revenue and also has made the comapny face very high competition from other Telecommunication companies. Due to this impact the company has hired me to analyse their past data and come up with business insights and new strategies of reducing the customer churn rate.The aim of this project is to analyze past data of SyriaTel telecommunication company and come up with machine learning algorithms to predict whether a customer will churn or not. By analyzing Syrial Tel past data, which includes customer information eg `account length`, charges per call, minutes the customer get from the company,International plan and voice mail plan,and past churn records. By identifying this patterns and major factors that contribute to a customer churning away from SyrialTel, I will be able to predict wether a customer is likely to churn or not.

### Project Description
 This project is about analyzing Syria Tel historical data and building models that will predict wether a customer is likely to churn or not and what features contribute to customer churning away from the SyriaTel company.
 Main problems addressed by this project are:
 - Revenue loss by SyriaTel
 - Customer Dissatisfaction

#### Objectives of this project
This project aims to:
- Analyze SyriaTel's historical customer data which includes behavioral,minutes usage patterns,Charges inorder to predict wether a customer will churn or not
- Develop predictive models
